Editor
======

Simple text editor built with JavaScript and knockout.js. 
Not really meant to replace a full-featured editor, just a test to 
see how much I could do with knockout.js.

Demo available here:

Just start typing and it'll work. Arrows, enter, tab, home, end, auto-scrolling all work.

Things to work on
=================

1. Add save feature!
2. Page up and page down.
