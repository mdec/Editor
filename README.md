Editor
======

Simple text editor built with JavaScript and knockout.js. 
Not really meant to replace a full-featured editor, just a test to 
see how much I could do with knockout.js.

Demo available here: http://masondecamillis.com/projects/editor/editor-1.0.4.html

Just start typing and it'll work! Arrows, enter, tab, home, end, auto-scrolling all 
have normal effect.

If you want to use these files, you'll need to point the HTML file to a knockout.js
source somewhere.

Things to work on
=================

1. Add save feature!
2. Page up and page down.
